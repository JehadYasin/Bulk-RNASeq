# Bulk-RNASeq

This is an R script for bulk RNA-Seq analysis.

The first section involves analyzing RNA-Seq data from two samples of yeast cells subjected to stress.

The second section of the file (starting at line 129) uses a ready counts file (GSE143630_RCC_htseq_counts.txt) and illustrates the ways of analyzing RNA-Seq counts. 
The counts represent gene expression data in stage 1 and stage 2 human renal cell carcinoma and compares them. 

Files:
- GSE143630_RCC_htseq_counts.txt: RNA counts file for stage 1 and stage 2 renal cell carcinoma
- Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.dna_sm.toplevel.fa: Reference genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's Yeast)
- Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.R64-1-1.96.gtf: GTF file of accharomyces cerevisiae's genome
